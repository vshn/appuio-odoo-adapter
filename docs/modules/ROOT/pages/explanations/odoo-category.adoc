= Effects Of Invoice Category Parameters

Odoo lets users customize the PDF render output using categories ("sections") in invoices.
Each category has the following additional properties:

sequence::
controls how line items are grouped together and how each category is ordered within an invoice.

pagebreak::
causes the next line item to be on the next page in a PDF (after the last line item).

separator::
causes a line printed with `\***` after the last line item within the same category.

subtotal::
causes an additional line printed with an accumulated subtotal of all line items within the same category.

== Sequence Number

If there are line items with sections defined, the rendering of an invoice is influenced by their section configuration.

=== Unique Sequence Numbers

If no two categories in an invoice share the same sequence number, then each line item gets grouped together when rendered in a PDF regardless of their position in the invoice data record. However, the ordering of the line items _within_ the same category is still determined by the ordering in the invoice record.

=== Shared Sequence Numbers

If two categories in an invoice share the same sequence number, then line items only get grouped together when rendered in a PDF when they are sequentially ordered in the invoice data record.
That means that line items may become distributed with their sections displayed multiple times.

In the example below all categories share the same sequence number.
The line items within the `test-category with subtotal` are grouped together since they are positioned next to each other in the invoice data record.
The line items within `test-category with separator` got separated since the line item within `test-category without any flags` is positioned between the others in the invoice data record.
